# AlignID — quick photo resizing for IDs & passports

AlignID is a simple, client-side web tool that helps you crop and resize photos to common ID and passport specifications. It runs entirely in your browser—no sign-in, no uploads.

> ⚠️ Always verify your country’s official photo rules (size, DPI, background, head size, glasses, etc.). AlignID is a helper tool, not legal advice or an official validator.
